Zomato home-page clone — Description & copy you can use

Below are several ready-to-use descriptions and copy blocks for a Zomato home-page clone — pick whichever fits your README, project portfolio, or the site itself. I included a short SEO meta description, an elevator pitch, a longer project description, a features list, sample hero heading/subheading/button text, and a short “how it works” blurb.

1) SEO meta description (short)

A fast, responsive Zomato-style food ordering homepage clone showcasing restaurant discovery, search, menus, ratings and online ordering. Built for demo and learning.

2) Elevator pitch (1–2 lines)

A Zomato home-page clone that replicates the look-and-feel of a modern food discovery app: search nearby restaurants, browse curated collections, view menus and ratings — all in a clean, responsive UI built for learning and demonstration.

3) Full project description (for README / portfolio)

This project is a front-end clone of Zomato’s home page, recreated as a learning/demo application. The homepage focuses on fast restaurant discovery and an intuitive ordering flow. Key elements include a prominent search bar (location + cuisine), nearby restaurant cards with images and ratings, curated collections (e.g., “Top Rated”, “Budget Eats”, “New in Town”), restaurant filters (cuisine, cost, delivery time), and CTA components for viewing menus or starting an order. The layout is fully responsive, with accessible components and polished microinteractions (hover, card shadows, and loading skeletons) to mimic a production product. This clone is intended for portfolio display, frontend practice (HTML/CSS/JS or React), and UI/UX exploration — not for commercial use or to imply affiliation with Zomato.

4) Key features (bullet list)

Responsive hero with location + search (cuisine, restaurant).

Restaurant listing cards: image, name, cuisine tags, rating, delivery time, cost.

Curated collections / categories carousel.

Filter and sort controls (rating, delivery time, price).

Simple modal or page for restaurant menu and item details.

User interaction patterns: hover states, favorites (UI-only), skeleton loaders.

Mobile-first design with hamburger navigation and sticky header.

Accessibility basics: semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard focus states.

5) Sample hero copy & CTAs

Headline: Hungry? Find great food near you.
Subheadline: Discover local restaurants, check ratings and menus, and order delivery in minutes.
Primary CTA: Search restaurants
Secondary CTA: Explore collections

6) “How it works” (short)

Enter your location or allow location access.

Type a cuisine or restaurant name in the search bar.

Browse restaurant cards — filter or sort as needed.

Click a restaurant to view its menu and start an order.

7) Technical stack suggestion (optional)

HTML5, CSS3 (or Tailwind) for layout and styling

JavaScript (Vanilla / React) for UI interactivity

Optional: JSON file or mock API (e.g., JSON Server) for restaurant data

Deployment: GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify

8) Legal / ethics note (must include)

This is a learning/demo clone. Do not use trademarked logos, proprietary images, or claim affiliation with Zomato. Use placeholder images or properly licensed assets.

If you want, I can:

produce a short tagline for your portfolio,

write the README.md with install/run steps,

generate the hero HTML + CSS snippet (responsive),

or create sample JSON data for restaurants.
